# Topological analysis of networks

[Network Analyzer: Topological analysis of networks (from Cytoscape manual)](https://manual.cytoscape.org/en/3.7.2/Network_Analyzer.html)

This is the Cytoscape User Manual page where the tool NetworkAnalyzer is described. NetworkAnalyzer computes a comprehensive set of topological metrics for undirected and directed networks, including:

- Number of nodes, edges and connected components.
- Network diameter, radius and clustering coefficient, as well as the characteristic path length.
- Charts for topological coefficients, betweenness, and closeness.
- Distributions of degrees, neighborhood connectiveness, average clustering coefficients, shortest path lengths, number of shared neighbors and stress centrality.
