# Visualizing expression data on networks
This is the description of a Cytoscape tutorial that presents a scenario of how expression data and network data can be combined to tell a biological story and includes these concepts:

- Visualizing networks using expression data
- Filtering networks based on expression data
- Assessing expression data in the context of a biological network

You will first import the GAL1 GAL4 GAL80 interaction network from NDEx. 
Then you will import expression data from a table and will integrate interaction data with expression data.

You can find the Tutorial here: [Cytoscape Basic Data Visualization Tutorial](https://cytoscape.org/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/basic-data-visualization)

In the tutorial you will need to import the GAL1 GAL4 GAL80 interaction network and expression data data from a table. To this aim, you may find it useful the following Cytoscape tutorials:
- Importing networks: see [Cytoscape Loading Networks Tutorial](https://cytoscape.org/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/loading-networks/#/)
- Importing data from tables: see [Cytoscape Importing Data From Tables Tutorial](https://cytoscape.org/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/importing-data-from-tables/#/)
