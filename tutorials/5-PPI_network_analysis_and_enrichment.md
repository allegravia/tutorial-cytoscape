# Tutorial on protein network interaction analysis and functional enrichment analysis

### Target audience
Cytoscape novices / beginners

### Contents

1.	Introduction
2.	Learning outcomes
3.	Requirements 
4.	Cytoscape 
5.	Tutorial 

### Introduction
In this tutorial, we will use a practical example to show how to use the popular open source tool Cytoscape to both upload and to build (through the PSICQUIC client to access several protein interaction repositories at the same time) a PPI network and explore it in order to detect topological properties, find topological clusters, and use the BINGO app to **perform GO enrichment analysis of the network**. 

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this tutorial the learner should be able to:
-	Upload a PPI network in Cytoscape
-	Build the same PPI network from Cytoscape using PSICQUIC
-	Save Cytoscape sessions
-	Filter out interactions with low score
-	Select nodes and edges
-	Download and use the BINGO app 

### Requirements
In order to carry out this tutorial, you need:
1.	Cytoscape version 3.10.1 or more (downloadable from [www.cytoscape.org](www.cytoscape.org))
2.	A list of proteins you want to build a network from (e.g. parkinson_uniprot_list.txt)
3.	The corresponding network table (file Parkinson_MITAB2.7.txt)
4.	BINGO app installed in Cytoscape
