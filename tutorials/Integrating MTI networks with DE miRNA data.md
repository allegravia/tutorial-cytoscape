## Tutorial: Integrating miRNA-target gene networks with transcriptomics data

This tutorial describes a network analysis workflow in Cytoscape for integrating miRNA expression data in a network of miRNA-target interactions (MTI).
Overall, the workflow will fo through the following points:

    - Loading a network of validated miRNA-target interactions (MTI) derived from public databases
    - Finding a set of differentially expressed miRNAs in a dataset of interest
    - Integration and visualization of experimental data in the MTI network
    - Network filtering based on significance level from test of differential expression
    - Network functional enrichment analysis on selected target nodes
    - Basic Network analysis
