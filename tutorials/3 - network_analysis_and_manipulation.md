# Topological analysis of networks

This is the Cytoscape User Manual page where the tool Analyzer is described. Analyzer computes a comprehensive set of topological metrics for undirected and directed networks, including:

Number of nodes, edges and connected components.
Network diameter, radius and clustering coefficient, as well as the characteristic path length.
Charts for topological coefficients, betweenness, and closeness.
Distributions of degrees, neighborhood connectiveness, average clustering coefficients, shortest path lengths, number of shared neighbors and stress centrality.
