# Topological analysis of networks

[Network Analyzer: Topological analysis of networks](https://manual.cytoscape.org/en/3.10.1/Network_Analyzer.html)

This is the Cytoscape User Manual page where the tool NetworkAnalyzer is described. NetworkAnalyzer computes a comprehensive set of topological metrics for undirected and directed networks, including:

Number of nodes, edges and connected components.
Network diameter, radius and clustering coefficient, as well as the characteristic path length.
Charts for topological coefficients, betweenness, and closeness.
Distributions of degrees, neighborhood connectiveness, average clustering coefficients, shortest path lengths, number of shared neighbors and stress centrality.

Comprehensive online documentation and a tutorial for NetworkAnalyzer are available at [http://med.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/networkanalyzer/](http://med.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/networkanalyzer/).
