The following files will be used to run the cytoscape tutorial **"Integrating miRNA-target gene networks with transcriptomics data"**
- **hsa_MTI__strong.csv** [miRNA-target interaction network]: experimentally validated miRNA targets provided by [miRTarBase](https://mirtarbase.cuhk.edu.cn/) (release 8.0) filtered for strong experimental evidence [1,4M; plain text; multi-column; comma-separated values]
- **TCGA_BRCA_mirs__DEoutput__wMiRBaseAnnotations.txt** [miRNA expression data - disregulation in breast cancer]: output from differential expression analysis of miRNA expression data in breast cancer and normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-BRCA) [122K; plain text; multi-column; tab-delimited]. Pre-processed miRNA sequencing data used to run the differential expression analysis was obtained by using the Bioconductor package [*curatedTCGAData*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/curatedTCGAData/inst/doc/curatedTCGAData.html).
- **nodes2type.txt** [node annotation table]:  mapping of human genes to gene biotype, obtained from Ensembl [BioMart](https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/) [1,2M; plain text; two columns; tab-delimited]
